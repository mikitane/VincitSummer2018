# Duck sightings app

This app is a part of Vincit Summer 2018 application. Backend is done by Vincit Group Oyj.
My own production is located in frontend directory.

In this app you are able to view all the duck sightings that others have posted.
You can also add your own sightings. App has two different view choices: cards
or list. The sightings can be sorted by date.
